How To Run
----------
Last time it seemed that compiling on your Linux machine using Swift worked out.
Compiling with any version of Swift equal to or higher than 4.0 should work again
this time.
So to get it built just make sure you have swift installed and enter the pa2 directory.
Also make sure the PA2_test.sql is in the pa2 directory.
Once you're in the directory run this command in terminal: "swift run pa2 PA2_test.sql"
It should build and run and print the output to the console.

If you have any issues feel free to contact me at willallstead@icloud.command
Thanks!

How Tuples are Stored
---------------------
Tuples are stored in a table under the table metadata in the table files.
Tuple insertion is done by editing that file, inserting at whatever tuple index is required.
Tuple deletion is done similarly, but then collapsing the file to remove empty whitespaces.
Tuple modification is done similarly as well.
Tuple queries use the metadata section of the table file to find the index of the columns to be queried, and those respective cols are changed in their respective rows.
